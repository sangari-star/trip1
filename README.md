I Created a Tripadvisor Website 

🌍 TripAdvisor Clone Website – Travel Reviews & Booking Platform
Project Overview:

I created a front-end clone of the popular travel site TripAdvisor using HTML5 and CSS3. This project showcases a responsive layout and clean UI design that mimics the functionality and appearance of a real travel review and booking website.

Key Features:

✈️ Homepage with search bar for destinations, hotels, restaurants, and experiences

🏨 Featured listings for top-rated hotels and attractions

🖼️ Gallery sections with images, ratings, and user reviews

📱 Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views

🎨 Custom CSS styling for menus, cards, buttons, and footer

🧭 Navigation bar with links to Hotels, Restaurants, Things to Do, and Flights

Technologies Used:

HTML5 for structuring the content and layout

CSS3 for styling, layout design, and responsiveness

Media Queries to ensure the site looks great on all screen sizes

(Optional: You can mention adding JavaScript later for dynamic functionality.)

If you'd like, I can help you write an About section or a more tailored project description for your GitHub, portfolio, or code comments. Just let me know!
